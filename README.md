## Dependencies

To make this app work we need a BE server that serves data for our application. No worries it's already available. Go to this url [BE app] (https://github.com/biju16mvk/order-tracking-be) and clone/download the the repo and run following commands

### `cd order-tracking-be`

This will spin up a backend sever that runs in port 6060. You can change this port to the one you want, but make sure to update the same in the `constants.js` file of FE application.
